        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 to 6 pork chops*, boneless or bone-in*</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Cuban Pork Chops Marinade</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1/3 cup neutral cooking oil</li>
            <li>4 tbsp lime juice, freshly squeezed</li>
            <li>1/4 cup orange juice, freshly squeezed</li>
            <li>8-10 garlic cloves, crushed, then minced very fine</li>
            <li>2 tbsp dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 tsp cumin</li>
            <li>1 tsp coarse salt</li>
        </ul>
       </div>
       <div>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Trim any excess fat from around the pork chops.</li>
            <li>In a freezer-bag or non-reactive container mix the marinade ingredients coat the chops all over. <br>
                Marinate refrigerated for a few hours and up to 24.</li>
            <li>Bring them to room temperature and preheat the oven to 350 F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper (optional, for easier clean up).</li>
            <li>Place the pork chops on the baking sheet, discard the marinade. Season with salt and pepper.<br>
                Bake for about 12-15 minutes, then flip them over, season other side as needed.</li>
            <li>Continue to bake for a few extra minutes (anywhere from 5 to 15), but watch them closely. <br>
                Alternatively you can broil them once you flip them for an appetizing finish.<br>
                The food safe internal temperature is 145 F, but up to 170-180 F is fine for pork shoulder or collar chops.</li>
            <li>Take them out of the oven, tent them with foil and allow them to rest for 5 minutes. Serve.</li>
        </ol>
