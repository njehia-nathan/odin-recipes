            <h3>Steps</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine all ingredients on medium speed with the paddle attachment. <br>
                    (If working by hand, stir together all ingredients in a medium bowl with a wooden spoon or spatula.)</li>
                <li>Switch to the dough hook attachment and knead on medium speed for 5 minutes, until dough is smooth and elastic.<br>
                    (If working by hand, turn dough out onto a lightly-floured surface and knead 8-10 minutes, until dough is smooth and elastic.)</li>
                <li>Lift dough out of bowl, then drizzle bowl with olive oil. Return ball of dough to bowl, turning to coat with oil.<br>
                    Cover and allow to rise in a warm place 45-60 minutes, or until roughly doubled in size.</li>
                <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly-floured surface. Divide into two, and shape each half into a ball. <br>
                     (At this point, you can refrigerate or freeze one of the crusts for another day.) <br>
                      Allow to rest for 10-15 minutes to allow the gluten to relax. In the meantime, preheat oven to 450°F. <br>
                      If you have a pizza stone, preheat it in the oven during this time.</li>
                <li>In a medium bowl, toss chopped vegan chicken with 1/3 - 1/2 cup buffalo sauce, depending on how spicy you like things.</li>
                <li>Roll dough out to 14” round (depending on how thin you prefer your crust, and the size of your baking pan). <br>
                    If using a pizza pan, you can sprinkle it with cornmeal if you like. If using a stone, you can prepare your pizza peel <br>
                    or transfer pizza dough onto a tRoll dough out to 14” round (depending on how thin you prefer your crust, and the size of your baking pan). <br>
                     If using a pizza pan, you can sprinkle it with cornmeal if you like. If using a stone, you can prepare your pizza peel or transfer pizza dough <br>
                     onto a thin sheet of parchment to slide it onto the stone.</li>
                <li>Pour about 1/4 cup buffalo sauce and 1/3 cup vegan blue cheese dressing onto the pizza crust and spread evenly. Spread buffalo chicken and red onions <br>
                    or scallions over top. Sprinkle pepper jack shreds over all.</li>
                <li>Bake in preheated oven 12-15 minutes, or until cheese is melted and crust is golden brown. Allow to cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. <br>
                    You can finish it with an extra drizzle of buffalo and blue cheese dressing, and an extra sprinkle of sliced scallions, if you like.</li>
