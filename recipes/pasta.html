            <h3>Ingredients</h3>

                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh basil (plus more for serving)</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano </li>

                <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>¼ cup water</li>
                <li>1½ pounds ground "meatloaf mix" (approximately equal parts ground beef, pork and veal)</li>
                <li>¾ cup dried Italian style bread crumbs (such as Progresso ) </li>
                <li>½ cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese (plus more for serving)</li>
                <li>Large jar (32 oz) good quality Marinara sauce (such as Rao's)</li>
                <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F and set an oven rack in the middle position.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the egg, basil, parsley, oregano, salt, pepper, garlic and water. <br>
                    Add the meat, breadcrumbs and cheese and mix until just combined (your hands are the best tool). Do not overwork it.</li>
                <li>Roll the mixture into golf ball-sized meatballs and place on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake for about 10 minutes, <br>
                    then remove the baking sheet from oven and use a metal spatula to turn the meatballs (they will stick a bit but should <br>
                    release easily when you scrape under them with the spatula). Put the meatballs back in the oven and cook for another 10 minutes,<br>
                     until they are nicely browned and almost cooked through.</li>
                <li>In the meantime, bring the marinara sauce to a simmer in a large skillet. Taste it and adjust the seasoning if necessary <br>
                    (I usually add a healthy pinch of sugar and some freshly ground black pepper). Transfer the browned meatballs to the marinara sauce,<br>
                     leaving the fat behind. Cover loosely with a lid or foil and simmer for about 10 minutes, until the flavors marry and the meatballs are cooked through. <br>
                     Keep warm until ready to toss with pasta. </li>
                <li>While the meatballs are cooking, bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook until al dente. <br>
                    Drain, then toss with the sauce and meatballs (you may find it easier to toss everything together in the pasta pot rather than the skillet; <br>
                    it depends on the sizes of pans you are using.). Serve topped with fresh basil and more grated cheese.</li>
